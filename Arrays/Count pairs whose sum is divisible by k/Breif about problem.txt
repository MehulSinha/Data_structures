    Count pairs in array whose sum is divisible by K:

Given an array A[] and positive integer K, the task is to count total number of pairs in the array whose sum is divisible by K.

Examples:

Input : A[] = {2, 2, 1, 7, 5, 3}, K = 4
Output : 5
Explaination : 
There are five pairs possible whose sum
is divisible by '4' i.e., (2, 2), 
(1, 7), (7, 5), (1, 3) and (5, 3)

Input : A[] = {5, 9, 36, 74, 52, 31, 42}, K = 3
Output : 7


Approach: An efficient approach is to use Hashing technique. We will separate elements into buckets depending on their (value mod K). When a number is divided by K then the remainder may be 0, 1, 2, upto (k-1). So take an array say freq[] of size K (initialized with Zero) and increase the value of freq[A[i]%K] so that we can calculate the number of values giving remainder j on division with K.
